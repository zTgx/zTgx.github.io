Some systems like Ubuntu, MySQL is using the UNIX auth_socket plugin by default.

```shell
sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was a new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;

+------------------+-----------------------+
| User             | plugin                |
+------------------+-----------------------+
| root             | auth_socket           |
| mysql.sys        | mysql_native_password |
| debian-sys-maint | mysql_native_password |
+------------------+-----------------------+
```

As you can see in the query, the root user is using the auth_socket plugin.

There are two ways to solve this:

You can set the root user to use the mysql_native_password plugin
You can create a new db_user with you system_user (recommended)

```shell
sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

sudo service mysql restart
```
