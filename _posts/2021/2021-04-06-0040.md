### OpenCL是干什么的 [^1]
OpenCL is a new, powerful toolset for building parallel programs to run on highperformance processors. With OpenCL, you don’t have to learn device-specific languages; you can write your code once and run it on any OpenCL-compliant hardware.  

***

### 有什么特点
* portability  
* standardized vector processing  
* parallel programming  

***

### 基本概念有哪些
* Platform  
* Device  
* Host  
* Context  
* Kernel  
* Command queue

***

### 进一步补充
OpenCL code consists of two parts:   
* code that runs on the host and   
* code that runs on one or more devices.  

Host code is written in regular C or C++ and is responsible
for creating the data structures that manage the host-device communication. The host
selects functions, called kernels, to be placed in command queues and sent to the
devices. Kernel code, unlike host code, uses the high-performance capabilities
defined in the OpenCL standard.

***

### Boost.compute 又是什么 [^2]
Boost.Compute is a GPU/parallel-computing library for C++ based on OpenCL.  
The core library is a thin C++ wrapper over the OpenCL API and provides access to compute devices, contexts, command queues and memory buffers.

***

### 系列说明
图片和部分概念参考了[OpenCL-In-Action]这本书。[^3]  
之后的相关文章及代码主要是使用 `boost.compute` 来进行的，会涉及一些 lowapi。
