**When comes to Game Programming, Coding Standard first.**

### Naming Conventions
* Template classes are prefixed by `T`.
* Classes that inherit from UObject are prefixed by `U`.
* Classes that inherit from AActor are prefixed by `A`.
* Classes that inherit from SWidget are prefixed by `S`.
* Classes that are abstract interfaces are prefixed by `I`.
* Epic's concept-alike class types (used as the first argument to the TModels type trait) are prefixed by `C`.
* Enums are prefixed by `E`.
* Boolean variables must be prefixed by b (for example, bPendingDestruction, or bHasFadedIn).
* Most other classes are prefixed by `F`, though some subsystems use other letters.
* Typedefs should be prefixed by whatever is appropriate for that type: F if it's a typedef of a struct, U if it's a typedef of a UObject and so on.

### Range for
```c
TMap<FString, int32> MyMap;

// Old style
for (auto It = MyMap.CreateIterator(); It; ++It)
{
    UE_LOG(LogCategory, Log, TEXT("Key: %s, Value: %d"), It.Key(), *It.Value());
}

// New style
for (TPair<FString, int32>& Kvp : MyMap)
{
    UE_LOG(LogCategory, Log, TEXT("Key: %s, Value: %d"), *Kvp.Key, Kvp.Value);
}
```

### Typed Enums
```c
// Old enum
UENUM()
namespace EThing
{
    enum Type
    {
        Thing1,
        Thing2
    };
}

// New enum
UENUM()
enum class EThing : uint8
{
    Thing1,
    Thing2
}
```
**enums exposed to Blueprints must continue to be based on uint8.**

### General Style Issues
* Always use the TEXT() macro around string literals. Without it, code that constructs FStrings from literals will cause an undesirable string conversion process.
* Use This: `FShaderType* Ptr`
* Use the virtual and override keywords when declaring an overriding method. 


### Platform-Specific Code
```c
Engine/Platforms/[PLATFORM]/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/[PLATFORM]PlatformMemory.cpp
```
