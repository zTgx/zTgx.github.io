在上篇中 `hash_combine_impl` 有 `0x9e3779b9` (2654435769), 它是怎么来的？  

```c
template <typename SizeT>
inline void hash_combine_impl(SizeT& seed, SizeT value)
{
    seed ^= value + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed<<6) + (seed>>2);
}
```

***

The magic number is supposed to be 32 random bits, where each is equally likely to be 0 or 1, and with no simple correlation between the bits. A common way to find a string of such bits is to use the binary expansion of an irrational number; in this case, that number is the reciprocal of the golden ratio: [^1] [^2]
```c
phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
2^32 / phi = 0x9e3779b9
```

So including this number "randomly" changes each bit of the seed; as you say, this means that consecutive values will be far apart. Including the shifted versions of the old seed makes sure that, even if hash_value() has a fairly small range of values, differences will soon be spread across all
the bits.
